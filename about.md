## Good job! ##

You've found blog of Matthew Marchese. This is one of my [many projects](http://maffblaster.github.io/projects/). I try to find time to write about what I am currently learning about or doing. If you want to learn more about my likes and interests keep reading.

[Titus 2:11-14; 3:3-8 ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A11-14%2CTitus+3%3A3-8&version=ESV) would be a good representation of my beliefs about reality. I was born a wicked person, but by God's grace He saved me to live a life set apart for Him.

I try to make my purpose to glorify Him just as His Son.

### Role models: ###

Excluding the many men found in the pages of Scripture, I have found the following men to be personal life examples for me to follow: Butch Pursley and the other elders at [Maranatha Bible Church](http://www.mbc95.org/), [Jonathan Winn](https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.winn.5) and [Nathan Kurcsak](https://www.facebook.com/nathan.kurcsak) and a few of the past or present [pastors](http://www.mbc95.org/about/ministry-staff/) that shepherd at Maranatha Bible Church in Akron, Ohio. [Dan Jarms](https://www.facebook.com/dan.jarms), [Yogi Naresh](https://www.facebook.com/ynaresh), [David Gamon](https://www.facebook.com/dgamon), [Walt Takisaki](https://www.facebook.com/walt.takisaki), [Jerod Gilcher](https://www.facebook.com/jerod.gilcher), and the other former or current [elders](http://www.fbchurch.org/who-we-are/pastors-elders/) at [Faith Bible Church](http://www.fbchurch.org/) in Spokane, Washington.

Here are some men that I'm not directly connected with, but from their works, writings, and ministries are found to be both honorable and respectable:
[Dr. John F. MacArthur](http://www.gty.org/), [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington), Martin Luther, [Jonathan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28theologian%29), [Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster), [Samuel Smiles](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/224?sort_order=title), [Ravi Zacharias](http://www.rzim.org/),and Ben Stein.

My name is *Matthew*. I highly prefer *Matthew* it over its shortened, halved version. I'm married to my closest friend, my wife Christina.

### Worth some earth-time: ###

* Reading God's Word.
* Ministering in the local church.
* Learning and helping others learn.
* [Digital Survival](http://www.digitalsurvival.us/) (my super not-so-secret side project).
* My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Maffblaster).
* [Sermons](http://www.fbchurch.org/sermons/service-type/college/) from Jerod Gilcher.
* [Sermons](http://www.resolved.org/) from the Resolved Conference.
* Lane Chaplin's [Blog](http://www.lanechaplin.com/).
* [WranglerStar's YouTube channel](http://www.wranglerstar.com/) - Cory is a good role model for anyone who desires to live a free and productive life.
