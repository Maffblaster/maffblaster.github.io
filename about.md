##**Good job!**##

You've found the experimental blog of Matthew Marchese. This is one of [my](https://github.com/MarcheseComputer) [many](https://github.com/Maffblaster) [projects](https://github.com/DigitalSurvival), but I still try to find time to write about what I'm currently learning about here.

##**about me:**##

[Titus 2:11-14; 3:3-8 ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A11-14%2CTitus+3%3A3-8&version=ESV) would be a good representation of my beliefs about reality.

It is my sole purpose to glorify Him as His Son did, although this goal is not easy and I don't do as well as I should.

Excluding the many men found in the pages of Scripture, I have found the following men to be personal life examples for me to follow: Butch Pursley, Steve Marshall, and the other elders at [Maranatha Bible Church](http://www.mbc95.org/), Jonathan Winn and Nathan Kurcsak and a few of the other [pastors](http://www.mbc95.org/about/ministry-staff/) that shepherd at Maranatha Bible Church in Akron, Ohio. Dan Jarms, Yogi Naresh, David Gamon, Walt Takisaki, and the other [elders](http://www.fbchurch.org/who-we-are/pastors-elders/) at Faith Bible Church. Jerod Gilcher and the other pastors at [Faith Bible Church](http://www.fbchurch.org/) in Spokane, Washington.

Here are some men that I'm not directly connected with, but from their works, writings, and ministries are found to be both honorable and respectable:
[Dr. John F. MacArthur](http://www.gty.org/), George Washington, Ben Stein, [Ravi Zacharias](http://www.rzim.org/), Noah Webster, Jonathan Edwards, and Martin Luther.

My name is *Matthew*. I highly prefer Matthew it over its shortened, halved version. I'm married to my closest friend, my wife Christina.
