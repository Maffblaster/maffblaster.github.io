##**good job!**##

You've found the personal (and experimental) blog of Matthew Marchese. This is one of my [many projects](http://maffblaster.github.io/projects/), but I still try to find time to write about what I'm currently learning about or doing. If you want to learn more about my likes and interests keep reading.

##**about me:**##

[Titus 2:11-14; 3:3-8 ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A11-14%2CTitus+3%3A3-8&version=ESV) would be a good representation of my beliefs about reality. I was born a wicked person, and because I'm not in heaven yet I'm still wicked, but by God's grace He saved me to live a life set apart for Him.

It is my sole purpose to glorify Him as His Son did, and although it's not easy I keep going.

Excluding the many men found in the pages of Scripture, I have found the following men to be personal life examples for me to follow: Butch Pursley and the other elders at [Maranatha Bible Church](http://www.mbc95.org/), Jonathan Winn and Nathan Kurcsak and a few of the past or present [pastors](http://www.mbc95.org/about/ministry-staff/) that shepherd at Maranatha Bible Church in Akron, Ohio. Dan Jarms, Yogi Naresh, David Gamon, Walt Takisaki, Jerod Gilcher, and the other former or current [elders](http://www.fbchurch.org/who-we-are/pastors-elders/) at [Faith Bible Church](http://www.fbchurch.org/) in Spokane, Washington.

Here are some men that I'm not directly connected with, but from their works, writings, and ministries are found to be both honorable and respectable:
[Dr. John F. MacArthur](http://www.gty.org/), [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington), Martin Luther, [Jonathan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28theologian%29), [Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster), [Samuel Smiles](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/224?sort_order=title), [Ravi Zacharias](http://www.rzim.org/),and Ben Stein.

My name is *Matthew*. I highly prefer *Matthew* it over its shortened, halved version. I'm married to my closest friend, my wife Christina.


##**favorite quotes:**##

"A loss of faith is not too much thinking but too little." -[Timothy Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Keller_%28pastor%29)

"The crown and glory of life is Character. It is the noblest possession of a man, constituting a rank in itself, and an estate in the general goodwill; dignifying every station, and exalting every position in society. It exercises a greater power than wealth, and secures all the honour without the jealousies of fame. It carries with it an influence which always tells; for it is the result of proved honour, rectitude, and consistency — qualities which, perhaps more than any other, command the general confidence and respect of mankind." -[Samuel Smiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Smiles)

“The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions.” -[Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster)

"We must not think that God doeth a thing because it is good and right, but rather is the thing good and right because God willeth it and worketh it." -[William Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Perkins_%28theologian%29)


"Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence; true friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation." -George Washington

"We are free to do what we like, but we are not free to like what we ought to like." -[Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)
