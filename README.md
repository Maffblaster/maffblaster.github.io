###maffblaster's blog:

Congratulations, you've found my personal blog! I hope you find interesting things I have to say. If you're interested in the Bible, home improvement, Gentoo, or economics you just might enjoy what I have to say.

Find out more about what I'm working at these other locations:

[Digital Survival](http://www.digitalsurvival.us/) → An organization dedicated to keeping individuals as digitally free as possible.

[Marchese Computer](http://www.marchesecomputer.net/) → (this isn't really a project, it's more of a small business...)
