Lately I've been helping a few friend with their computer problems (they were all using Windows, go figure!). In my experience helping them, there appears to have been a "flare up" of nasty malware that creates ad popups in the Chrome web browser. Out of the four people I assisted, two of them had problems with ads appearing, even when the websites they were currently browsing did not have ads.

It would appear my brain simply cannot stop desiring to learn new facts. One of the best ways to see how well I understand the knowledge my brain contains is to teach *others* about what I know. Scripture talks about Discipleship being a core part of what Christians should practice.

What this is boiling down to, is that I believe it would be valuable for *others* and for myself to teach a computer and technology class at my local church. There's so much everyone should know about technology...

For example: there are a few simple steps my friends could have taken to avoid obtaining the nasty software they unknowingly put on their PC.

1. Avoid Scams - Go to either official or *trusted* sources for downloading new software or software updates.
2. See Everything - Choose "Custom" install for every software package installed. 
3. Do it right the first time - Review every page of the installer CAREFULLY. Do not skip a page because reading is not desired at the moment. Much time can be saved if the software is installed correctly the first time.
4. Be careful which addons/extensions/plugins
5. Use helpful addons/extensions to increase security while browsing. [NoScript](https://noscript.net)
6.
