Over the past couple of weeks I've migrated some of the last remaining information from oldwww (lingo for the old Gentoo website) to the Gentoo wiki. Since I have really been only effectively editing/adding articles since late 2013, I will round up and say I have been working for about one year. I have contributed a total of *4,436 individual edits* to the wiki in the 2015 year, although these stats do not mean much. In all reality, it's the *quality* of the edits that really matters, not the *quanity*.

These migrations include:

* [The Security Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Security_Handbook) - Be careful, it is a little out of date!
* [The Developer Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Developer_Handbook) - Contained at least one question in the ebuild quiz, but is helpful for general developement knowledge.

Since the year is quickly coming to a close, I thought it would be good to time to reflect on the Wiki project's 2015 roadmap goals.

The following goals were complete for this year:

* ~~Update InfoBox template.~~ - Done! (a3li )
* ~~Encourage the teams to start moving their documents from wwwold. Assist where needed.~~ - Done! (maffblaster )
* ~~Write articles for some of the Requested articles during summer of 2015.~~ - Done! (maffblaster and other wiki contributors)
* ~~Build a community of competent Wiki contributors to help write the Requested articles: write contributor's guide.~~ - Done! (maffblaster )

The following goal was not completed:

* Update USE flag template.

The USE flag goal is a tricky problem because, since the goal was created, https://packages.gentoo.org has been updated. The new packages.g.o site dynamically generates USE flags based on changes in the Portage tree itself. It would be nice as a 2016 goal to provide updates from packages.g.o to a USE flag template on the wiki. I'm not sure if current wiki softawre allows for this kind of update system or not, but it would be a lot better than attempting to maintain something that can update dynamically in a static environment.

In total, four out of the total of 5 large goals were met in 2015. That is good progress! I was able to meet lots of smaller personal goals. They can be found [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Maffblaster/Completed_tasks#2015) if anyone is actually interesting in looking at them. My overall goal for the Gentoo wiki is for it to become **the best Linux related wiki on the web**. It has vastly improved over the past year, but it still has some way to go before I would call it "the best."

In 2016 I would like to see these things happen within the wiki community:

* More active contributors - I know theres many in the Gentoo community who have a lot of knowledge. What better place to dump this knoweldge than on the Gentoo wiki! Most of the current contributors are translators, which typically does not add more content to the wiki; it only makes existing content available in other languages.
*
