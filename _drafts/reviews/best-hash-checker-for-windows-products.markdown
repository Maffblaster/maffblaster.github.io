Probably the most convenient MD5/SHA-1 hash checker I've used on Microsoft Windows is called HashCheck. It's very simple program that integrates into the properties window. It's free and open source, released under the BSD license. If any of the development work you do is on Windows I'd recommend adding it to your Windows developer toolbox.

You can find [HashCheck at on its official website](http://code.kliu.org/hashcheck/).

Some of the other tools this developer created are dated, but they might still be useful for certain projects. Find more at his website: [http://code.kliu.org/](http://code.kliu.org/)
