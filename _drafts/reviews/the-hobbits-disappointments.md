I've seen the last two modern Hobbit films in theaters. Almost a year ago now, after I watched the second film, I was so disappointed that I made a commitment to not go see the last film in theaters. Yes, I'll watch it eventually, but I'm not paying to see something that has left the spirit of Tolkien.

If you've read the books you'll know what I'm referring to about the "spirit of Tolkien." I thought the Lord of the Rings, although there was non-canon filler, did well at keeping the spirit of Tolkien.

The Hobbit is just goofy. On top of it's goofiness is layered so much non-canon filler that the film should not be considered the Hobbit anymore.
