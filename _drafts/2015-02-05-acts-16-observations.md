Follow along with my observations by [reading this section of Scripture on Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016&version=ESV).

**Timothy Joins Paul and Silas**

Timothy was the son of a Jewish woman, but his father was Greek (16:1).

How old is Timothy when he first meets Paul?

Why did Paul circumcise Timothy?

What was Paul, Silas, and Timothy's task as they went from city to city (16:4)?

Why were the churches strengthened in their faith (16:5) as a result of Paul and Timothy's task?

**The Macedonian Call**

In this section Paul and his company were "forbidden by the Holy Spirit"  to speak the word in Asia (16:6). They attempted to travel to another city but "the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them" (16:7).

Does God still lead His people His people in this way today?

How do we know if God does or does not want us to do a certain thing?

Can we know what God's will for our lives is? How can we know?

**The Conversion of Lydia**

For the women (or men) in this group, what are some interesting observations you can make about Lydia?

What positive elements from her brief mention

**Paul and Silas in Prison**

What is the lie in 16:20-23?

**The Philippian Jailer Converted**
