Today I learned why binaries are all over the place in Linux. Apparently it's because no one really questioned the system. What can I learn about this? Well, simply this: questioning the system is good, but if an expert in the field gives you a decent answer for why they do what they do, then you were warned.

You can read more about it here: [http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html)

I've been doing a lot of system questioning lately; a lot of things that will require me to reform some areas of my life. No, I'm not questioning my faith. The Scripture is *far* too consistent for that to happen, but I am questioning the many things, some related to Scripture and some not. These thoughts merit some text on a virtual page, but they'll have to wait.
