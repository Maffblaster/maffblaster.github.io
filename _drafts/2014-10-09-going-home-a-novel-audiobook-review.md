My wife would define me as a critic. I would say that I do, in fact, try to be a critic when it comes to media. Every film, every book; every form of media that I input I enjoy "digesting" in conversation with my wife or others.

Starting this book review of Going Home: A Novel by A. American will create a new category: a review category!

Summary of Going Home: A Novel:

A man who lives in Florida goes on a business trip. While he is on the road everything goes dark. Luckily he was already prepper so he was somewhat prepared for his current scenario. The story is primarily about his journey on the road, the people he meets, and the situations he encounters.

Let me first state by expectations for the book. I've read (via audiobook) the first Patriots book (from [the Patriots series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots_Novels_Series) by [James Westley, Rawles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wesley_Rawles)). In my understanding, Rawles is the modern father of survivalism. I also am coming into the audio book as an almost daily viewer of [WranglerStar's YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/wranglerstar) (check it out if you're interested in modern homesteading).

Although I usually enjoy survival fiction, I found a few issues with this book.

The dialog between the characters in the story appears to me to be a bit lacking. Even if A. American would have used less profanity (the book is riddled with it; several F words and many other sexually explicit terms, D works, B words, etc.) I doubt I would have enjoyed the book as a whole because of the dialog. Some examples of bad dialog: "We looked at each other with that 'WTF' look in our eyes." Or "his 'oh s***' face." This phrase, or something similar, was used at least twice in the book. There were several other nasty phrases through out. They do not need to be covered here in detail. If that's all the author could come up with then he's in a sad state. 

This is mere speculation, and should not be considered as fact, but there might be a reason A. American would like to use a pseudo, or pen, name in order to publish works. He/she seems to be quite "inexperienced" with survivalism. I would highly doubt this person has personally put into practice the efforts of one prepared for a TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know It) event. I think a bit more real-life experience would be helpful in making the book seem more like an actual event than complete fiction.
