I've seen the last two modern Hobbit films in theaters (An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug). Almost a year ago, after I watched the second film, I was so disappointed that I made a commitment to **not** see the last film (The Battle of Five Armies) in theaters. Yes, I'll watch it eventually, but I'm not paying money to a film that has entirely left the spirit of Tolkien in order to please feminists, greed, and the masses.

If you've read the books you'll know what I'm referring to about the "spirit of Tolkien." I thought the Lord of the Rings, although there was a lot of non-canon filler did well at keeping the *spirit* of Tolkien in the trilogy. The Hobbit, however, is another story.

Many parts of the The Desolation of Smaug were, simply put, goofy. It is understandable the Hobbit, being a prelude to The Lord of the Rings, was written as a children's book. Some silliness, cuteness, and fun is required. Jackson took far too many liberties that the final product was rendered unbelievable from a purist's point of view. Elves and Dwarves do not get along. They never have. 

On top of it's goofiness is layered so much non-canon filler that the films should actually be considered Hobbit fan fiction.
