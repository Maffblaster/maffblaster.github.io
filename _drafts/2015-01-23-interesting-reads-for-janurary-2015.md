This month I started a Biblical Counseling class. So far it is definitely one of the best classes I've taken. The class has a heavy reading loading, but it has been balanced with a heavy discussion period (two hours) inside the class room. At this point in the class (three weeks in) I would recommend it to any serious Christian. As explained in the class, you are a counselor whether or not you desire to be a vocational counselor.

For this class I've been taking a look at the Westminister Confession of Faith: [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)
