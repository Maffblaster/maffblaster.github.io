"Open source" or "free software" is a philosophy that was started by some hackers and tinkerers in the 1980s. Although there were many involved in the movement, the most outspoken was [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman). There is actually a convenient Wikipedia article on the [history of free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software) if you would like to do some detailed reading on the subject. Being a Christian and a free thinker, I agree with many of Stallman's philosophies concerning the use of software and the freedoms that should naturally come with its use. After all, most of the freedoms simply make sense. There are a few points that I would disagree with him on, mainly political, but I'll save those for another article.

In my mind software is in a unique category when compared to tangible assets. Software is non-tangible. It is abstract. It is literally organized, electrical information across various mediums. Software is different than any other physical thing for a few reasons:

1. Software can only do the things it was made to do. Improvements cannot be made to the code to make it do what the user would like it do. *Closed source* software can only the thing that is was built to do. Because of licenses, under the law, the end user is *not* permitted to modify the software in ways that could make it better or more useful. Doing so would be a violation of the law. This is distinctly different than other physical things that people purchase and modify for other use. For example, if you owned a truck, and because of the work you do with the truck you would like to add on a trailer and a snow tires, you are free to so because you *own* the truck. The truck can be opened up, parts added or removed, and put back together without any violations of the law. Warranties might become void, but the owner is, of course, doing it knowing that risk. With closed source licenses, software owners are not able to modify software because they are denied access to the source code. In fact, they do not actually own the software. They have only purchased a licensed COPY of the software. All the rights belong to the software company who legally owns them.
2. With a truck, you have the freedom to *repair* the truck if it were to break down as long as you have the knowledge, tools, time, and materials, etc. With closed source software, the end user is not permitted to open the hood (so to speak) to see how things are operating.
3. With a truck (or any other physical items that you legally own), you are able to take it apart and sell each piece as you see fit. This is useful if your truck gets old, or if it broken beyond repair. Once closed source software has aged is it becomes obsolete and essentially is thrown away. There is no way for the end user to re-use or "piece out" the software, because it is illegal to do so.

In short, closed source software makes it impossible to act on a survivalist mindset because it is illegal (or totally impractical) to do the things a survivalist would be interested in doing (tinkering, enhancing, improving, fixing, etc).

Welcome to open source. Open source code reveals the internals of the software to allow users to do whatever they desire with the code. They can add functionality to the code, create new code based on the original code for a specific purpose, or use the code as-is. They can even give the code away to others who want to be able to use the newly written code.

It is easy to see from the above examples with the truck, that anyone who cares about survival, homesteading, or personal benefit should prefer open source software over closed source alternatives.

Open source software is best suited for the survivalist mindset.
