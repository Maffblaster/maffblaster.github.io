"Open source" or "free software" is a philosophy that was started by some hackers and tinkerers in the 1980s. Although there were many involved in the movement, the most outspoken was [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman). There's actually a convenient Wikipedia article on the [history of free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_and_open-source_software) if you'd like to do some detailed reading on the subject. Being a Christian and a free thinker, I agree with many of Stallman's philosophies concerning the use of software and the freedoms that should naturally come with its use. There are points that I would disagree with him on, mainly political, but I'll save those for another article.

In my mind software is in a unique category when compared to tangible assets. Software is non-tangible. It is abstract. It is literally organized, electrical information on various mediums. Software is different than any other physical thing for a few reasons.

Examples:

1. Closed source software can only do one thing: the thing that is was built to do. Because of licenses, under law, the end user is not permitted to modify the software in ways that could make it better or more useful to the end user. This is different than other physical things. For example, if you owned a truck, and because of the work you do with the truck you would like to add on a trailer and a snow tires, you are free to so because you own the truck. Under closed-source licenses, the end users are not able to modify software because they are denied access to the source code.
2. With a truck, you have the freedom to repair the truck if it were to break down as long as you have the knowledge, tools, time, and materials. With closed-source software, the end user is not permitted to open the hood (so to speak) to see how things are operating.
3. With a truck (or any other physical items that you legally own), you are able to take it apart and sell each piece as you see fit. This is useful if your truck gets old, or if it broken beyond repair. Once closed-source software has aged is it becomes obsolete and essentially is disguarded. There is no way for the end user to re-use or "piece out" the software, because it is illegal to do so.

In short, closed source software makes it impossible to live a survivalist mindset because it is illegal to do the t
