For many who have not studied theology the term "sanctification" may be a word unfamiliar. This word typically does not appear in daily water cooler conversations around the office and does not present itself in many forums of literature. It certianly does not appear in technical writing. 

Although not a fully accurate representation of all the facets of the word, using computer scientist terminology, sanctification is best described in two terms: 1) incremental improvement 2) set apart (special). Similar to the process software engineers (developers) follow to make improvements to applications over time, sanctification is a means to continual, incremental improvements.

Sanctification is what God does to those he has saved. He helps us become more like Himself, which practically means that we (Christians) will be improving day by day. Before more and more like the second person of the Trinity, Christ Himself.

Sanctification is God's plan for our lives. The following verses found in the Bible explain God's plan of sanctification:

####Sanctify meaning *incremental improvement*:

"**Sanctify** them in the truth; your word is truth." John 17:17

"For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your ***sanctification***: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you." - 1 Thessalonians 4:2-8

"Now may the God of peace himself ***sanctify*** you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Thessalonians 5:23

"But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through ***sanctification*** by the Spirit and belief in the truth." 2 Thessalonians 2:13


####Sanctify meaning *set apart (for special use)*:

"To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those ***sanctified*** in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:" 1 Corinthians 1:2

"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were ***sanctified***, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." 1 Corinthians 6:11

"So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to ***sanctify*** the people through his own blood." Hebrews 13:12

Why does God sanctify Christians? What is His motive? We know that God sanctifies people because He loves them.
