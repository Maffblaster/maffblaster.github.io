For many who have not studied theology the term "sanctification" may be a word unfamiliar. This word typically does not appear in daily water cooler conversations around the office and does not present itself in many forums of literature.

Although not a fully accurate representation of all the facets of the word, using computer scientist terminology, sanctification is best described as incremental improvements. Similar to the process software engineers (developers) follow to make improvements to applications over time, sanctification is a means to continual improvement.
