Sometimes, but not often, I read Reddit. Today I was looking at [Neil deGrasse Tyson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) Reddit page entitled [I am Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ask Me Anything...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/)

For those who do not know, Tyson is a scientist who has become an internet celebrity of sorts (as far as the Reddit community is concerned). He specializes as an astrophysicist. It is very neat that certain "celebrities" can have public pages where they interact with their fans by answering questions.

Eventually I came across [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wgcif) which states:

<blockquote>"What can you tell a young man looking for motivation in life itself?"</blockquote>

Tyson [responds](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wgffy) by saying:

<blockquote>"The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.
For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."</blockquote>

Tyson's response, like many agnostics, is for the young man to look within *himself* in order to find the meaning of life. This worldview is common among those who deny God's power and is all together different than what Scripture teaches. This Tyson's statement is ultimately hopeless. Knowing more about the world does not induce hope. Lessening the suffering of others can produce hope, however for the young man the question remains: what *is* suffering? With no objective moral standards and no universal absolutes (they can only happen with the existence of a universal standard) how can one truly define suffering? Suffering for a partaker in conservative Islam would mean strapping explosive substances to the body and blowing up himself and others in the name of Allah. The young man might be suffering from not understanding the purpose of life. A woman who's been in multiple relationships of her own choosing but has not found her desires met with any of them might constitute suffering. How can her suffering be relieved. I doubt Tyson has good answers to any of these questions. How could someone develop good answers when they do not have the truth?

The Scripture teaches that the meaning to life is not found within ourselves; the meaning of life it is found within* the Scripture*. Scripture alone has the answers so life's biggest problems. The Scriptures are able to provide *hope* to those who are lost in the philosophies of men. As the Westminister Confession of Faith so eloquently states:

<blockquote>"[Scripture is] The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith *and life*, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture..."</blockquote>

That is to say the Scripture contains all things needed both for faith *and for life*.

Verses that support this view are as follows:

<blockquote>"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." -1 Timothy 3:16-17</blockquote>
