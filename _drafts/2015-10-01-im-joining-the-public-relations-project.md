The newest team that I've joined as I continue to contribute to the overall wellness of Gentoo is Public Relations. One of the ways I see Gentoo improving is in outreach to the community; specifically for the purposes of pulling in young blood: the next generation of developers. Fortunately there is already a project that specializes in relating to the public: that's PR. Unfortunately some of the things on PRs radar seem to have disappeared.
