uTorrent apparently had some kind of Bitcoin mining software included. Looks like someone people thought they could harness those wasted CPU cycles on peer-to-peer (P2P) machines.

It was a good idea only if the users knew about it and agreed. I'm sure some people wouldn't mind "supporting" torrent software maintainers by donating unused cycles. Unfortunately it was not released as public information.
