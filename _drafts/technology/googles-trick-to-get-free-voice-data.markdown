When I saw the Chrome blog post about [*Spell Up*](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/05/speak-to-learn-with-spell-up-our-latest.html), Google's "latest Chrome Experiment," I believed I could see right through what Google's secret plan. Well, I'm not sure if it's really a secret plan or not, but what better way to get people who speak English with foreign accents to speak into Google's voice interface?

Google already has people talking into their phones using the "Ok, Google" command. Since Feburary, 2014 using the same syntax people could [use Google Chrome to talk to the Google search page](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2014/02/hands-free-google-voice-search-in-chrome.html) on their computer, and now they can "play a game" in order to learn English better.

Is there any other ways Google is collecting data about how many people form their words? Yes, actually, there are more ways. One of the ways, which I am guilty of using, is Google Voice/Talk/Hangouts. If you are a user of Google Voice or any related services listen in this paragraph, anyone who leaves a message or talks to you on your phone (while you're connected through Google's servers) has entered their vocal data into Google's voice database. Google already has pretty much all the information that could possibly want on me. Which is yet *another* motivation for me to start Digital Survival.
