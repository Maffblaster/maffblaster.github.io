There wasn't much good information on the web about installing Gentoo Linux on a ThinkPad W530, although there were a few helpful resources that I've included at the bottom of this entry. If you were searching the internet for information on how to do what is in the title of this article, I hope you find this entry to be *most* helpful. 

I know I'm writing to a very small portion of the world's population. Seriously, how many people actually purchased a W530? Probably less than 250,000 W530s were produced...still I believe this entry will be helpful for some. Lets get started!

I adapted a version of this install guide for both Digital Survival and the official Gentoo wiki.
