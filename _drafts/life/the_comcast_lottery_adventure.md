This week my wife and I officially moved in to our new home. Naturally, in order to stay current with first world technology, we needed to have an internet connection installed to the house. Let me tell you a story of how that went...

In the city of Spokane, WA there are really only two choices when it comes to internet: Comcast or CenturyLink. There are a  couple satelite internet providers in the city, but they have much slower bandwidth so we ruled them out as viable options. Between the two "land line" options Comcast offers faster speeds, but is generally more expensive. CenturyLink is the opposite: slower speeds, but is generally more affordable. After getting some advice by some friends at my place of employment we decided to go with Comcast as our ISP (Internet Service Provider).

A few days ago my wife called their 1-800 (toll free) phone number in order to determine pricing. I've lived in Spokane long enough to understand that Comcast employees play a pricing game, but I was definitely not expecting the monkey shine my wife was about to go through with the Comcast sales representatives over the phone.

My wife calls the company and we determine together the optimum speed for us to pay for is 50 Mbps. The first "offer" she received was $39.99 per month for the 50 Mbps. She explained to the employee that the offer sounded reasonable, but she will have to talk to her husband before entering the contract and call them back. So, she talks to me and I give her the OK to proceed making the deal. She then calls back Comcast. The next person she talks to informs her that the deal she was just offered is not actually available, but she could get 50 Mbps for $49.99 per month. She's not too satiated with the apparent "miscommunication" between employees. Again she decided to talk to me before we entered into a more expensive contract with them, and she told the person on the phone she would call them back after talking it over with her husband. After she informed me of the developments I was a bit frustrated. I asked her why they couldn't make good on the first offer they provided and asked her to call them a third time to ask for the first offer of $39.99.

She calls again, a third time, this time the price was up to $104.99 per month. At this point she is starting to catch on. She calls them back a fourth time. The price is now $45.99. Finally, she calls back a fifth time. The price is an affordable $34.99 for 50 Mbps. STAY! I proclaimed.

Getting a good price for internet from Comcast is like playing the lottery. Just keep trying until you get something you like.
