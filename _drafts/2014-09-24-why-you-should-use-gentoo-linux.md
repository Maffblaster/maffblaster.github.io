Unashamedly the purpose of this entry is to convince you to use **Gentoo Linux** as your operating system of choice. Second only to getting the house I've just purchased fixed up, my project, Stage7, is focused on increasing the usability and convenience of installing Gentoo Linux. I believe usability and convenience are two of the distribution's largest weaknesses. With that being said, I'm convinced its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.

In order to have a full comprehension of Gentoo's strengths and weaknesses, you'll first need to understand the philosophies behind free and open source software. I take a particular and specific view on open source because I am always thinking about old-world living. Being self-sufficient and independent. If you haven't already,  you should read this entry before proceeding.

*Gentoo's Weaknesses?*

As briefly stated above the initial weakness a user will encounter when attempting to use Gentoo is a difficult time installing it. If the user is used to anything like the installers used in Ubuntu, Fedora, or RedHat they will not know where to begin. Gentoo's traditional method of installation is to install everything by hand. This method usually entailed downloading a Gentoo Minimal Install image, burning the image onto a CD or DVD disk, booting to the disk, downloading the 

Another weakness is the time it takes to configure and build packages. The very thing that empowers Gentoo also makes it have unique time trades. Building the packages that you will be using on your system from source takes time. The more CPUs the build system has, and the faster those CPUs run will reduce the build times of the packages, however package installations will still take longer than binary-based distributions. For convenience, there are a few larger packages that are pre-built in the Portage tree. A few of these being:
firebox-bin
openoffice-bin
libreoffice-bin
