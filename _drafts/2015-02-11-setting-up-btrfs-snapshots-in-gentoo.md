Recently at work one of my co-workers helped me in setting up BTRFS snapshots on an important system. It is much easier than one would expect, even though BTRFS is a more complected and capable file system than the alternatives.

###Concepts

Subvolumes

Snapshots

Filesystem structure

### The files needed

/etc/fstab

cron job


I would like to create an entry on how to make quick, disaster proof recoveries on Gentoo using BTRFS, however that will be the content of another entry in the future.
