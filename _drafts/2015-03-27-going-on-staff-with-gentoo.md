On Mar 6th 2015, which was three weeks ago, I posted an entry titled "Exciting News. " At that time I was not so confident that what was *proposed* was actually going to happen; I was still wading through some of the specifics and did not want to reveal any false information.

The time has come! As the title of this entry suggests, I am on the way to becoming a staffer with Gentoo! I have long admired those in the project since my mid-teenage years.  I never considered I would one day be officially involved with the project.

### How did this happen? ###

 I decided at the beginning of this year to increase my knowledge of Gentoo. My plan was to start helping out with documentation. The easiest way to do this was to start editing articles on the Wiki. In my mind this was a win-win situation. Not only could I gain an understanding of more technologies, but the Gentoo project would benefit from having the documentation proof read, reviewed, edited.
 
 After contributing for about two months of contributions a user by the name of [a3li](http://a3li.li/) (Alex Legler) offered to let me officially start the staffer process.

To date I have contributed 710 edits to the wiki, which is more than I thought before checking to write this entry. Editing has been a very enjoyable process because during editing I am always learning, evaluating, and improving my personal understanding of technologies and the information on the Wiki. Editing the Wiki will be something that I'll continue to do, even if I move on to being involved with other projects. My frequency of edits may be reduced, but my commitment to excellent documentation will *never* die.

### Why documentation matters ###

Many who are not in my position may think writing documentation is not fun. Perhaps they are missing the* value* of accurate documentation. For any open source project documentation matters...*a lot!* 

* Without good documentation users would have an extremely difficult time attempting to use the software
* Gentoo, a source-based distribution, is *almost* easy to use, as long as good, accurate, up to date documentation exists.

### Levels of Gentoo Involvement  ###

There are a few difference tiers of involvement. This I have learned from taking the Staff quiz.

First, there is the staff level. Staffers have a higher amount of privileges than users of the Gentoo project. Staffers do things like user support on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), write documentation (the Wiki), and produce the Gentoo Monthly Newsletter (GMN). To become on staff with Gentoo a staff quiz must be filled out, then sent to the developer/staffer who offered to let you come on staff.

Second, there are developers. Developers have all the privileges of staffers, and more. Developers can do things such as pull and push code from the Git repositories, maintain ebuilds, edit all pages on the wiki, and e-mail on the <code>gentoo-core</code> mailing list. To become a developer another quiz call the developer quiz, must be taken.

Counsel members.
