There are a few things I do not enjoy about using Windows.

The first thing I do not enjoy is being *forced* to restart the system after updates. I understand that sometimes, in order to all the changes to make their complete effects, the system needs to restart. I just don't appreciate the way the machine is force to restart with the timer. I guess I could get around having to restart for Windows Updates by disabling the Windows Update completely, however this does not seem like the best idea. Especially because sometimes Windows Updates are important for a system to not be venerable to certain types of attacks.
