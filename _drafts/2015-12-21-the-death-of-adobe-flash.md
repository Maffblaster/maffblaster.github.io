Now that two of the largest video web sites on the Internet ([YouTube](http://youtube-eng.blogspot.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html) and [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/159906447698921)) have completed their transitions, the migration away from Adobe Flash is almost complete! Open source formats have finally become mainstream. But what does this mean for you? Doing away with Adobe Flash is good for the following three reasons:

* Security - In the GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Annoucement) list for 2015, Adobe Flash was reported nine times for "multiple vulnerabilities". To Adobe's credit they have continued fixing these critical security vulnerabilities, however they discontinued updating the version of flash available for NPAPI-based web browsers in Linux [since 2012](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplatform/whitepapers/roadmap.html).
* Liberty -
* Transparency -
