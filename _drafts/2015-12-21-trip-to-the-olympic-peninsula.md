This weekend my wife, sister, and I went to a wedding of a good friend in the Washington's [Olympic Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula). It is certianly one of the most beautiful places I have seen in the states. It was green; very green. It rained a lot. There were lots of farms and small harbors.

Cast iron and [Soapstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapstone) stoves.


In other news:

* I got a new mouse. It's not a super good one, but it is an upgrade over the minimal one I was using previously.
* Forget hadoop; I'd much rather refrain from a single purpose application. I'll use something like Atom or LightTable to write entries from now on.
