Scenario: You've installed Gentoo, but you're having issues that you don't know how to resolve. Maybe a package isn't able to compile. Maybe you're not sure exactly what use flags you should be using. You have blockers on the system and can't <code>emerge -uND --with-bdeps=y @world</code> which is preventing you from updating your system. 95% of the problems I have had using Gentoo has been because I lacked the *knowledge* I needed in order to resolve the problem. If you've searched the internet (make sure you've search the official [Gentoo forums](http://forums.gentoo.org/)) but have not been able to find the information you need all hope is not lost! There are those smart nerds on the Gentoo IRC channel who are willing to help you troubleshoot issues you are having with doing all things Gentoo.

If you successfully connect to the IRC channel, you'll see a message like this:

<code>ChanServ: (notice) [#gentoo] Welcome to #gentoo || Acceptable Usage Policy @ http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/irc.xml || Keep the language clean || Google is your friend || No bots or scripts that talk || Turn off public away messages || More than three lines to #flood or a pastebin service, no spam!</code>

If you're using a graphical IRC client (such as Pidgin, Konversation, etc.) the ChanServ message will pops up in another tab. Now, pay close attention to what is written in this message. Here you will find the rules for the channel. I have another entry on rules that I'm working on right now and it will be linked to this entry soon.
