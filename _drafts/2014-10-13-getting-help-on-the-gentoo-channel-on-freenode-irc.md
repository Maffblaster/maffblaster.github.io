Scenario: You've installed Gentoo, but you're having issues that you don't know how to resolve. Maybe a package isn't able to compile. Maybe you're not sure exactly what USE flags you should be using. Or possibly there are blockers on the system which is causing <code>emerge -uND --with-bdeps=y @world</code> from updating the system. 95% of the problems I have had using Gentoo has been because I lacked the *knowledge* I needed in order to resolve the problem. If you've searched the internet (make sure you've search the official [Gentoo forums](http://forums.gentoo.org/)) but have not been able to find the information you need all hope is not lost! Smart gentlemen (and possibly even ladies) are usually available on the Gentoo IRC channel who are willing to help someone like you troubleshoot issues. Not to sound like a salesman, but these guys are SMART. They have knowledge of pretty much all things Gentoo and beyond.

The rest of this entry will be used to help people help people. Yes, you read that right, this entry will be helping users like you get help from other friendly, smart Gentoo peoples around the world.

Before the technical parts get started there are a few rules every potential IRC user should know about IRC.



If you successfully connected to the [Freenode] IRC channel, you'll see a message like this:

<code>ChanServ: (notice) [#gentoo] Welcome to #gentoo || Acceptable Usage Policy @ http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/irc.xml || Keep the language clean || Google is your friend || No bots or scripts that talk || Turn off public away messages || More than three lines to #flood or a pastebin service, no spam!</code>

If you're using a graphical IRC client (such as Pidgin, Konversation, etc.) the ChanServ message will pops up in another tab. Now, pay close attention to what is written in this message. Here you will find the rules for the channel. I have another entry on rules that I'm working on right now and it will be linked to this entry soon.
