It is astounding how lost people can be. Deceived by sin. Blinded by hollow Satanistic philosophies.

Watch this video then return here to finish this entry:

Sin is deceitful. A fallen, unrenewed heart is also deceitful.

*"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?" Jeremiah 17:9*

God is the great I AM.

What is interesting to me about the video is that these people are counseling themselves. This is a concept that the teachers of the Biblical Counseling class at Faith Bible Church have taught to the members of the class.

We, as humans, are all counselors. We are either counseling ourselves or counseling others. We counsel ourselves daily. The words that you speak to yourself that no one else can hear, generally non-vocal words, is your counsel. The challenge for Christians is to make this kind of self-counsel God-honoring. It's easy to counsel in humanistic, idolic ways. The mass of people, lead by Joel Osteen and Opera Winphery above are counseling themselves to worship themselves. They are glorifying themselves. They are exalting their own sovereignty.

This, in essence, *is Satanism.* Self-worship is Satanism. In a broad aspect, worshiping anything other than the one true God is Satanism.
