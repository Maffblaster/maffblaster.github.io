This entry is mainly about the doctrine of rules and laws. If this seems intriguing to you, please keep reading. Naturally, I will be addressing this topic by attempting to use a distinctly Christian framework of understanding reality. I could take an opposing view on the matter, however I must first resort to what I actually believe is true, which is that Christ came to earth, was crucified, and returned (rose) from the dead three days after the crucifixion. If the former sentence is true, then everything about reality must be reconsidered.

Reasons for the musing:

I was talking to a few college students a week ago or so at our Bible study when the topic came up: do Christians have to follow laws that don't make sense to follow. For that matter, does humanity, in general, have to follow laws that "do not make sense" to them? I will first attempt to address the issue from a Christian point of view.

Here are some examples of rules and laws in modern times that Christians might find to fit into the categories discussed above:

1) Traveling faster than the lawful speed on a national interstate highway? If the speed limit is 60 MPH, and you are traveling 70 MPH. Is going faster wrong for someone who professes to be a Christian?

2) You are enrolled at a private university, and there are a set of rules for all enrolled students to abide by. You choose to not follow those rules because you think they are silly, have no real purpose, and are legalistic. Are you actually doing something that would be against what Scripture teaches?

3) 

Examples of 

1) You have entered an IRC channel and one of the rules of the channel is to keep the language you use in the channel "clean." Presupposing there is a such thing as "right" or "wrong" behavior, is there
