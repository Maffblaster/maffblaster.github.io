Here I have included some quotes that have, in some manner (mostly positively), affected me over the years:

"A loss of faith is not too much thinking but too little." -Timothy Keller

"The crown and glory of life is Character. It is the noblest possession of a man, constituting a rank in itself, and an estate in the general goodwill; dignifying every station, and exalting every position in society. It exercises a greater power than wealth, and secures all the honour without the jealousies of fame. It carries with it an influence which always tells; for it is the result of proved honour, rectitude, and consistency — qualities which, perhaps more than any other, command the general confidence and respect of mankind." -Samuel Smiles

“The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions.” -Noah Webster

"We must not think that God doeth a thing because it is good and right, but rather is the thing good and right because God willeth it and worketh it." -William Perkins

"Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence; true friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation." -George Washington

"We are free to do what we like, but we are not free to like what we ought to like." -Augustine of Hippo

"Intellego ut credam" and
"Credo ut intelligam."
-Anselm of Canterbury

"What is the chief end of man?"

"There's no other Man who could save the dead
There's no other God to place our head" -Sufjan Stevens
