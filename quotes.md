Here I have included some quotes that have, in some manner (mostly positively), affected me over the years:

"A loss of faith is not too much thinking but too little." -[Timothy Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Keller_%28pastor%29)

"The crown and glory of life is Character. It is the noblest possession of a man, constituting a rank in itself, and an estate in the general goodwill; dignifying every station, and exalting every position in society. It exercises a greater power than wealth, and secures all the honour without the jealousies of fame. It carries with it an influence which always tells; for it is the result of proved honour, rectitude, and consistency — qualities which, perhaps more than any other, command the general confidence and respect of mankind." -[Samuel Smiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Smiles)

“The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions.” -[Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster)

"We must not think that God doeth a thing because it is good and right, but rather is the thing good and right because God willeth it and worketh it." -[William Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Perkins_%28theologian%29)

"Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence; true friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation." -George Washington

"We are free to do what we like, but we are not free to like what we ought to like." -[Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo)

"Intellego ut credam" and
"Credo ut intelligam."
-[Anselm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo_ut_intelligam) of [Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury)

"What is the chief end of man?" -[Westminster Confession of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith)

"There's no other Man who could save the dead.
There's no other God to place our head." -[Sufjan Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens)
