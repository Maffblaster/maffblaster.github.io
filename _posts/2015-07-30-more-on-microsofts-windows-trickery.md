 A while back I noted that the pre-release version of Windows 10 included a keylogger. At the time it seemed the keylogger was included for pre-release testing purposes. According to [this article](https://jonathan.porta.codes/2015/07/30/windows-10-seems-to-have-some-scary-privacy-defaults/) it looks like the release version not only includes a keylogger, but other types of spyware as well.

When you see something that's free, but the source code is not open, you should always ask the question: what do they have to hide? Why would they make the software free to use, but closed source? Does not make too much sense when one considers the massive benefits of having security hole discovered and fixed at a much faster rate.

I'm glad Microsoft has included switches to disable some of the spying they are asking permission for, although I'm sure the backdoors the US government will use are 'impossible' to disable.
