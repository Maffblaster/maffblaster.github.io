Christmas Surprise? Quite possibly! Or maybe I just missed all the discussion on when the change was going to take place.

The [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page) had a face lift this Christmas Day! It uses the same theme and layout as the [infra.gentoo.com](http://infra-status.gentoo.org/) site. I'm not one to complain.

Merry Christmas, everyone! A couple millenniums ago Christ was born. It was through His death on the cross that God made a way for sinners to be restored to Him. Thank God for the birth (and the death) of Christ!
