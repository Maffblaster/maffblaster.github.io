**For the First Time in Forever**

For the first time in forever (definitely not forever, but certainly a while) I'm (re)starting a blog. Ah! I knew the title would snare your interest! After all, it is one of the most popular lines in a chorus of a song from that that ever popular movie my cousin worked on.

What's special about this blog, as opposed to other blogs I've written, is that I'm finally able to have complete ownership of the data that leaves my body though the tips of my fingers. My very first blog on was on Xanga  (which I just had to reference to see if it was still actually hosted; it ).

My second form of "blogging" was writing Notes on Facebook. I didn't write very many, only a few. One of the things I like about Facebook is that it has a broad audience that is exclusive to my friends. I never wrote about anything too technical, but I did write about things that were important to me.

One of my more "important" notes was written to students about the school I attended. You can find more about me my following this link.

Since my first blog, I have a set of principals that I've been convinced of. A personal "code" or "system" that I desire to live out during my time on earth. I'm still determining exactly all of the values, but they surely will appear on this outlet soon enough. These personal principals are the reason I started Digital Survival.

This this the first blog post I've written using MarkPad. I'd found it simple, but helpful. It makes me desire to create a Markdown export feature to Nixnote. Hmmm, yes. That just might happen eventually.

More to come in the future.

Toodles,
