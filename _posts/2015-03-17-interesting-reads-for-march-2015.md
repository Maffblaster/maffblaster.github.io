It looks as if Windows 10 will include a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach of installing updates on their systems. This makes sense if there are several dozen Windows 10 systems on a LAN. It is so strange see Microsoft taking this approach. I have been pondering a P2P update system for users of Gentoo. I think P2P support could be built into (or excluded from) Portage with a simple USE flag modification.  Portage already has binary package support built it, so letting a P2P service run along side Portage could no only distribute source code (distfiles), but binary packages as well.
