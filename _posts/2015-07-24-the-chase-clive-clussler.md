### The Chase ###

The [Wikipedia article on The Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_%28novel%29) provides a decent overview of the story as a whole. There is no need for me to re-write the plot when it can be accessed with a click and a little reading.

#### Likes ####

* Noting a few disagreements on personal behavior in the early 20th century, I very much enjoyed the character Isaac Bell. 
* As normal, a slice of history was included in this novel: the [San Francisco earthquake of 1906](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake). I enjoy the mixing of fiction and fact; even reading a fun adventure story that is mostly fiction it is good to always be *something* about real earth history.

I give The Chase 7.5 stars out of 10. I liked this story much more than I liked "The Kingdom" which was written by the same author four years later.
