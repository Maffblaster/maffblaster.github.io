Many of you know my uncle walked from north-eastern Ohio to Alaska on foot back in the late '70s. What you might not have known is that my cousin Noah has taken his father's journal entries, newspaper clippings, and first hand accounts and has created something worth time spent reading. If you are interested in adventure or would like to read some fantastic blogging, I'd like to encourage you to subscribe to his [Wordpress blog](http://noahgrissett.wordpress.com/). You can find the first entry called "The Story in the Soul of His Shoes (Part 1) [right here](http://noahgrissett.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/the-story-in-the-soul-of-his-shoes/).
