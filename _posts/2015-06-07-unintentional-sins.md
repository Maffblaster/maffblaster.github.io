Did you know that unintentional sins need to be atoned just as much as intentional sins? We are guilty when we sin against God having knowledge of the sin or not.

Leviticus 4:1-35, 5:14-19; Numbers 15:25-29

Thank God for Christ who died so that our sins can be atoned!

"...even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Matthew 20:28
