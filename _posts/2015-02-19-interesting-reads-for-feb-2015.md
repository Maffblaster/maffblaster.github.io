Welcome to another month of interesting reads. There were a lot of things I've found interesting this month. Compared to interesting read entries I've done in the past entry is on the longer side.

###Equation Group

The GreAT research lab at Kespersky has made some super interesting discoveries in terms of malware. It has been determined an organization called the Equation Group has created malware that infects hard drive firmware. Since the malware is exists in the firmware and not on the actual platters it cannot be removed in a traditional sense (reformatting the drive).

Wired provides more in-depth details on how each of the discovered components works:

###Scripture

[Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017&version=ESV) is the section of Scripture that I'm leading discussion on this week. It's interesting to see the different reactions to the Gospel as Paul and Silas make their way through the cities of Thessalonica, Berea, and Athens.

That time Athens (Greece) was one of, if not the biggest, philosophic capitals of the world. People were interested in learning new theories and systems of thought.

John MacArthur has a couple of sermons I found interesting on this topic:

* [Men Who Turned the World Upside Down, Part 1](http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/1759/men-who-turned-the-world-upside-down-part-1)
* [Men Who Turned the World Upside Down, Part 2](http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/1760/men-who-turned-the-world-upside-down-part-2)
