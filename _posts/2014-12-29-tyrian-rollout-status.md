 While browsing the Wiki I finally found a "rollout" status page for Tyrian  â€“ The new look of Gentoo.org.
 
 [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Website/Tyrian/Rollout](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Website/Tyrian/Rollout)
 
 So far three Gentoo sub-domain sites have had the new look applied. The Wiki rollout status says "in progress" although it has been applied as of December 27th, 2014 (see my previous entry.)
 
 Over all I am pleased with the new look of Gentoo. There are some people who are apparently quite bothered about the JavaScript that is now needed in order to use the wiki site.
