Today I chose a name for a new Linux distribution: Vitality.

I chose the name Vitality for a few reasons:

* According to the The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition vitality can mean: "Power to survive: the vitality of an old tradition." This concept very much met my expectation for the purpose of this distribution. A goal of [Digital Survival](http://www.digitalsurvival.us/) is to connect old world ideas to new world technology.
* It was important to me to maintain a distinction between this operating system and Digital Survival (as an organization). This operating system is not the final product. Digital Survival is an organization that helps people become more independent, secure, and knowledgeable. Re-purposing old (or new) computer systems with a shiny operating system is worthy goal, but it's only a piece of the solution; there's more in order to sum the whole.
* Out of all the names I considered (it took a while) I thought this name was the most catchy and fitting. I might refine the name a little in the future. Maybe it will morph into "Vitality OS" or "Vitality Linux". Right now simply Vitality sounds nice.

Now it is time for me to get busy making this piece possible. If you want to help or have suggestions, please see the projects GitHub page:

It should be easy enough for most people to open a pull request there.

I'd like to thank my friend who goes by the pseudonym "NP-Hardass" for the sounding board he's been for some of my ideas. Thanks, NP!
