Rarely I see a movie that follows a logical sense of realism.

Rarely I see a movie that stays true to the canon as the author intended.

Rarely I see a movie that is acted and directed well.

Rarely I am satisfied with seeing images, rather than reading text.

A mission for myself: read more books. Watch less movies.
