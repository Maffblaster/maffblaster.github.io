An interesting article about re-writing software from scratch (something that I've considered before with a few personal projects) written by Joel Spolsky, the co-founder of Trello and Fog Creek Software, and CEO of the popular website Stack Exchange.

An article by Patrick Lauer, a Gentoo developer, about the knowledge required for a single developer to build a simple web-app. I found it interesting to know how much someone in the world of building computer applications, in this case a webapp, is required to "know."

This howto on virus writing for Linux is pretty neat. I didn't get a chance to read all of it, but I'd like to come back and read more once I get a break from working on the house. Maybe someone else who may be reading this blog will also find it intriguing.
