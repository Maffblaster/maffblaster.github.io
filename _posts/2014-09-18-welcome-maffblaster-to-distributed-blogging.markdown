Well, it's working and I'm winning. I love winning.

Why am I winning? Well, I'm winning because I've successfully configured (although the configuration is VERY basic) my first distributed blog.

There are several reasons why it took me a while to come out of my "shell" and start a blog for the internet masses to view. I wanted a hosting medium that I have complete control over. GitHub fulfilled my desires by providing Jekyll; and time will show Jekyll will prove to be very useful to both myself and many others who have similar patterns of thinking.

The time is now that I start going out and asking others who think like me to do the same. I want to be a voice for liberty, freedom, and privacy. A place like this can be an excellent way to do so.

GitHub, Jekyll is one of your best "features" yet. Keep working, you're doing a great job.

====What are the advantages of Jekyll?====

It's simple. When I hosted my first Wordpress website the setup was not as simple. Now, I have learned quite a bit more about networking than I knew at that time, so it might not be so difficult for me now, but it was difficult at the time.

It has the potential to be distributed. You can quickly and easily make copies of your site.

It's transparent. Those companies and organizations that have "nothing to hide" should really take advantage of Jekyll as a provider of free web hosting.

When hosting your site on GitHub version tracking is built in. Lost your local data? Clone the site again. Accidentally deleted your repository? Check with your friends, see if they cloned it while it was available.

====What are some disadvantages of Jekyll?====

It's transparent. If you do have something to hide there is not an easy way to hide it. Anyone has access to your posts, configuration files, graphics, and anything else you've uploaded to the repository.

No support for certain types of server side scripting. If you're really into PHP you probably will not have a large appreciation that Jekyll doesn't support it.

More to come!
