Two of my most-used programs on Windows include features to prompt the user for automatic updates. In one mouse click the programs then will proceed to download the update package and start the installer.

A few more clicks and and the programs will be updated to the newest version. I love open source programs that nicely suggest you update them to the newest versions.

The two programs I'm talking about here are **VLC** and **Notepad++**. Both are excellent programs. They are works of art and deserve to be utilized to their fullest potential.

I'd love to see do some research on how these programs automatically update. So for I've read a little bit on [Omaha - Google's silent, automatic updater](https://github.com/google/omaha) used for Chrome on Windows.

If I ever made a program that should be maintained I'll probably look into this using framework.
