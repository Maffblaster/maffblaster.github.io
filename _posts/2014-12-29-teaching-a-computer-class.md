Lately I've been helping a few friend with their computer problems (they were all using Windows, go figure!). In my experience helping them, there appears to have been a "flare up" of nasty malware that creates ad pop-ups in the Chrome web browser. Out of the four people I assisted, two of them had problems with ads appearing, even when the websites they were currently browsing did not have ads.

I'd love to teach others about what I know. Scripture talks about Discipleship being a core part of what Christians should practice. Teaching people what I know is one of the elements of the discipleship process.

What this is boiling down to, is that I believe it would be valuable for me to teach a computer and technology class to people in the local church. There are so many helpful things everyone should know about technology...

For example: there are a few simple steps my friends could have taken to avoid obtaining the nasty software they unknowingly put on their PC.

1. Avoid Scams - Go to either official or *trusted* sources for downloading new software or software updates.
2. See Everything - Choose "Custom" install for every software package installed. 
3. Do it right the first time - Review every page of the installer CAREFULLY. Do not skip a page because reading is not desired at the moment. Much time can be saved if the software is installed correctly the first time.
4. Be careful which Add-ons/extensions/plugins are used. Some of them contain ads.
5. Use helpful Add-ons/extensions to increase security while browsing ([NoScript](https://noscript.net), [AdBlock](http://adstomper.bitbucket.org/), etc.).

I'm sure there's more steps that I'm not thinking about, but if everyone followed only those five they would be much safer!

Who knows if I'll ever be a teacher...God knows! And He is in control.

More to come!
