If you have a high speed internet connection and you are renting your modem from the provider I only have one thing to say to you: **DON'T DO THAT**.

I purchased a modem recently on eBay for around $30.00. Comcast wants $8 per month to rent their modem. In four months the modem will pay for itself: $8 x 4 = $32. Save money! Buy a modem on eBay!

**Current projects:**

Repairing cracked floor joists

Getting Digital Survival internal services back online. 

More soon!
