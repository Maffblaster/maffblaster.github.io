The [First Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) reads as follows:

####"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

This short film, created by the New York Times, explains one of the reasons why so many people are opposed to NSA spying: it is essentially a step in the direction of making freedom of the press impossible. If the press gets a story the government doesn't want the public to know about, the government will stop the story before it can be released. That, friends, is a big deal.
