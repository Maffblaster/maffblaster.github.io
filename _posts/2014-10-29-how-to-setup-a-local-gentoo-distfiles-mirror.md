In the midst of some intense after-hours work on the new house I have finish a guide I drafted on [How to Setup a Local Gentoo Distfiles Mirror](http://www.digitalsurvival.us/2014/10/06/how-to-setup-a-local-gentoo-distfiles-mirror.html)). I thought you may like to read it. There were very few up-to-date Distfiles mirror guides on the web, so it should be helpful to some who lack the Distfiles survival knowledge!

I'll be contributing another similar guide on how to make a local Portage mirror soon.

**Current Projects**

* Demolition of nasty basement partition walls in the new house.
* Cleaning the new house.
* Removing faulty wiring and plumbing.
* Increasing power tool collection.
