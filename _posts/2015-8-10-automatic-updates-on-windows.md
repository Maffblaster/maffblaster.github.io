Two of my most-used programs on Windows include features to prompt the user for automatic updates. In one mouse click the programs then will proceed to download the update package and start the installer.

A few more clicks and and the programs will be updated to the newest version. I love open source programs that nicely suggest you update them to the newest versions.

I'm talking about **VLC** and **Notepad++**. Both are excellent programs. They are works of art and deserve to be utilized to their fullest potential.
