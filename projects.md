Here you can find a summary of my contributions to various projects. Things found here I have found to be particularly enjoyable to spent some earth-time:

## Personal ##

* [This video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### Ministry ###

* Currently serving in college ministry which impacts many details of life.

### Home renovations ###

* House #1 - I'm currently a home built in 1907. Soon you will be able to track progress on my blog.

### Wiki contributions ###

#### Gentoo ####

In the Gentoo project I have helped with the Wiki project and the documentation team. Gentoo is the most powerful, convenient distribution for developers - but only if you know you exactly what you want. Writing good documentation helps properly set user expectations by helping them determine exactly what they want so they can get what they need.

* [My Gentoo Wiki user space](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Maffblaster) - A point of reference on Gentoo related tasks.
* [The Complete Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Complete_Handbook) - An extended version of the Gentoo arch handbooks.

#### Wikipedia ####

* The [Gentoo Linux article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux) on Wikipedia.

## Digital Survival ##

### Vitality ###

* [Vitality](www.digitalsurvival.org/vitality) - A hardened Linux operating system optimized for containers. (This operating system is a work in progress...)
